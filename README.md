# dog_animacy_perception
Analysis of two eye-tracking experiments with dogs on animacy perception (self-propulsion, speed changes). 

## Markdown files
* Pupil size, area of interest, and motion tracking analysis for the different experiments
The pupil size analysis involves the following steps:
* Preprocessing of pupil size data (following the recommendations by van Rij et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1177/2331216519832483)
* Analysis of pupil size data using GAMMs (following the recommendations by van Rij et al., 2019, https://doi.org/10.1177/2331216519832483)
* Analysis of aggregated pupil size data using GLMMs
* Analysis of dogs' motion tracking (i.e. how well their vertical/horizontal gaze coordinates were explained by the vertical/horizontal coordinates of the moving stimuli)
* R script underlying Figure 1-4
